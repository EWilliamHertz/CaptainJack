                <h1>The Hunt for "Gold Money": The Morobe Goldfield</h1>
                <p>Captain Jack was "infected" with "gold-fever" by Joe Sloan. This obsession drove him and thousands of others into the jungle, risking malaria, blackwater fever, and attacks by hostile tribes for the chance at a fortune.</p>

                <h2>Module 1: The First Strike - Koranga Creek</h2>
                <p>The rush began with "Sharkeye" Bill Park. He secretly discovered gold on Koranga Creek and, in a conspiracy with District Officer Cecil Levien, began illegally smuggling it out. But "Sharkeye" was reckless. He failed to properly mark or register his claims as required by mining law.</p>
                <p>The expert "sour-dough" Joe Sloan, suspicious of Park's activities, tracked him into the jungle. He discovered Sharkeye's illegal "unnamed" claims ("#2, #4, and #6") and, seeing they were not legally protected, "confiscated... Claim #2" for himself. This claim "turned out to be the most profitable" on the creek and ignited the full-scale rush.</p>

                    <h3>Historical Context: The Levien-Park Conspiracy</h3>
                    <p>The memoir's account of a conspiracy is historically correct. Records confirm **Cecil John Levien (1874-1932)** was the District Officer at Morobe. He was the officer who found "Shark-Eye Park... illegally extracting gold from Koranga Creek".</p>
                    <p>Instead of arresting him, Levien "began quietly financing Park". He resigned from government service in 1923 to take out the **first miner's right** issued in the Mandated Territory. Levien was the true visionary of the goldfield, not as a prospector but as a promoter who foresaw the need for large-scale dredging and aviation. He founded **Guinea Airways** but died suddenly in Melbourne in 1932. His ashes were scattered over the Bulolo valley.</p>

                <h2>Module 2: The Partnership - Surprise Creek</h2>
                <p>Drawn by the "fever," Captain Jack partnered with Helmuth Baum for an expedition deep into the interior, up the formidable Watut River. The discovery came by pure chance. On a "whim," Jack decided to pan a small, unassuming tributary. He was stunned to see his pan "a quarter full" of coarse, heavy gold. They named it "Surprise Creek".</p>
                <p>Their work was immediately complicated by the local "Kokas-Kokas" (Kukukuku) tribe, who were openly hostile. The partnership ended in horror when Baum returned to the camp alone and was murdered in his tent, his head "crushed... with his stone club".</p>

                <h2>Module 3: The Big One - Edie Creek (Kiendi)</h2>
                <p>The true "Eldorado" was found in 1926 by Bill Royal, who discovered breathtakingly rich gold far up the mountain at Edie Creek (then called Kiendi). Royal and his partners immediately formed **"The Big Six,"** a syndicate of veteran miners.</p>
                <p>The six members, as confirmed by the memoir and historical records, were: **Bill Royal, Albert Royal, Dick Glasson (Lasson), Joe Sloan, Bill Money, and Bert Chisholm**.</p>
                <p>This syndicate used a controversial but legal tactic. Using leases meant for 240-acres, they claimed "miles of the creek" bed, "locking up" the entire valley. This shut out the hundreds of frantic prospectors who arrived after them. As a friend of Joe Sloan, Captain Jack was allowed to claim the land *above* them, the "fabulously rich" **"Sweden Lease,"** which yielded 100 ounces of gold per day.</p>

                <h2>Module 4: The Betrayal - The Stolen Gold</h2>
                <p>Captain Jack's "Sweden Lease" should have made him one of the richest men in the territory. He entrusted its operation to his partner, Peter Ide. It was a fatal mistake. Ide betrayed him, systematically stealing an estimated **400 kilograms of gold** from the claim.</p>
                <p>Ide, however, was "consumed by guilt" and terror. Before he could escape with his stolen fortune, he was struck by a violent case of blackwater fever. He died a sudden, agonizing death in Salamoa, taking the secret of the gold with him.</p>
