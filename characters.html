                <h2>Captain Jack (The Narrator)</h2>
                <p>A Swedish national, "Captain Jack" arrived in New Guinea in the 1920s, settling in Rabaul. He was a schooner captain, cargo master, and professional recruiter of native labor. His moniker was given to him by Solomon Islanders who couldn't pronounce his European name.</p>
                <p>His character is defined by his unique tools of colonial engagement: an accordion to "civilize" and entertain the tribes, and a small cannon to intimidate and awe them. When "gold-fever" struck, he pivoted to prospecting, and his 1951 memoir provides a raw, unfiltered eyewitness account of his adventures and the complex, prejudiced colonial mindset of the era.</p>

                <h2>Joe Sloan (The Expert "Sour-Dough")</h2>
                <p>Joe Sloan was a legendary "sour-dough" (veteran prospector) from Papua, known for his "remarkable ability" to navigate the jungle. He was the man who first infected Captain Jack with "gold-fever," an obsession that drove the entire narrative.</p>
                <p>Sloan's expertise allowed him to outmaneuver rivals. He famously tracked the secretive "Sharkeye" Bill Park to Koranga Creek and, discovering Park had failed to legally mark his claims, "confiscated" the richest one, "Claim #2," for himself. He later became a key leader of the "Big Six" syndicate that claimed the even richer Edie Creek.</p>

                <h2>Sharkeye Bill Park (The Rapacious Schemer)</h2>
                <p>Nicknamed for his "sharp glare" and "rapacious" business sense, "Sharkeye" Bill Park was the man who made the first major gold strike at Koranga Creek. He operated in secret, forming a conspiracy with District Officer Cecil Levien to smuggle out gold.</p>
                <p>Park's greed was his undoing. He illegally registered his claims with "no name" to hold the land for himself. When Joe Sloan discovered this, he was able to legally take over Park's discovery, leaving Sharkeye with nothing but his notoriety.</p>

            <section class="character-profile" id="helmuth-baum">
                <h2>Helmuth Baum (The Fated Partner)</h2>
                <p>A German ex-plantation owner, Helmuth Baum was described by Jack as a "knowledgeable, reliable and brave man". He had lost his plantation after WWI and survived by hunting birds of paradise. He became Captain Jack's partner on the perilous expedition up the Watut River, where they discovered the rich "Surprise Creek".</p>
                <p>Baum's partnership with Jack ended in tragedy. While Jack was in Rabaul, Baum returned to their claim against all advice. He was murdered in his tent by "Kokas-Kokas" (Kukukuku) tribesmen, who crushed his head with a stone club and killed his 13 carriers.</p>
                
                <div class="historical-context">
                    <h3>Historical Context: The Murder of Helmuth Baum</h3>
                    <p>The memoir's account is a primary source for a confirmed historical event. Records show that "the miner Hellmuth Baum" was killed in **April 1931**. His death "precipitated three patrols" and "the Administration authorised punitive patrols against the Kukukuku", resulting in "the decimation of three villages"—an event Jack himself describes taking part in.</p>

                <h2>Peter Ide (The Betrayer)</h2>
                <p>A New Zealander and ex-plantation manager, Peter Ide was one of Jack's original partners. After their first expedition failed, he and Jack partnered again to work Surprise Creek and later the "Sweden Lease" at Edie Creek.</p>
                <p>This trust was catastrophically misplaced. Ide systematically betrayed Jack, stealing an estimated **400 kilos of gold** from the "Sweden Lease". "Consumed by guilt," Ide fell violently ill. He died of blackwater fever in Salamoa just after being evacuated on the first-ever plane to land at Wau, taking the secret of the stolen gold to his grave.</p>

            <section class="character-profile" id="doris-booth">
                <h2>Doris "Angel of Bulolo" Booth (The Nurse)</h2>
                <p>One of the most famous legends of the goldfields, Doris Booth was an Australian nurse who refused to be denied entry into the "men-only" territory. She smuggled herself into Salamoa, trekked solo with carriers into the jungle, and established "Cliffside," a haven at Bulolo.</p>
                <p>Her status as the "Angel of Bulolo" was sealed during a deadly dysentery epidemic. She "had her boys build a primitive hospital" and, using her own medical supplies, "saved many lives". She was a true frontier icon, and her story was already a famous legend in Rabaul when Jack included it in his memoir.</p>

                <div class="historical-context">
                    <h3>Historical Context: Doris Regina Booth, O.B.E.</h3>
                    <p>Doris Booth's story is fully verified. Historical records confirm **Doris Regina Booth (1895-1970)** was an Australian nurse and goldminer. For her heroic work during the dysentery epidemic, she was awarded the **O.B.E. (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 1928**. Like Jack, she also published her own memoir, **<em>Mountain Gold and Cannibals</em> (1928)**. She later became the first female member of the Papua and New Guinea Legislative Council.</p>

                <h2>Harry Darby (The "Eldorado" Millionaire)</h2>
                <p>Harry Darby's story is a "million-dollar" legend of pure luck. He was an "impossible" and "crazy" government clerk in Rabaul, notorious for pranking the governor. After being fired, he went prospecting at Kiendi (Edie Creek).</p>
                <p>Arriving late, he found all the best land claimed. Needing to build an outhouse, he "ordered his boys to build... measured out a two-meter square" and, in digging the pit, they struck one of the richest claims in the valley. The "Eldorado" claim made him a millionaire, but he met a tragic end. After being cheated himself, "the police in Bombay found the little red-haired Englishman lying dead on the seashore... he had committed suicide".</p>

            <section class="character-profile" id="peter-hansen">
                <h2>Peter Hansen (The Pioneer)</h2>
                <p>Peter Hansen was an "old man" in Rabaul whose story was a famous legend told in the local bars. Known as the "King of Vitu," he had established a fortified copra plantation on Vitu Levu, building a "high palisade" to protect himself.</p>
                <p>His fort was attacked by natives, leading to a desperate five-day siege. He and his men made a last-second canoe escape and were rescued at sea "moments before" the war canoes caught them. Like Doris Booth, Hansen's story was recorded elsewhere; archives show his life story was formally recorded in a 1922 manuscript.</p>

            <section class="character-profile" id="tiger-lil">
                <h2>"Tiger Lil" Andreason (The "Gold Digger")</h2>
                <p>"Tiger Lil" embodied the "wild west" atmosphere of the frontier. A "tall and elegant blonde" in Wau, she was notorious for her "effective left hook" and her ability to "enchant men".</p>
                <p>Jack recounts a "macabre" barroom brawl between two of her suitors, Sam and Charley. When Sam bit off half of Charley's ear, Lil ended the fight in the most shocking way possible: she grabbed the urn containing her dead husband's ashes and "shattered it... at Charley's head," scattering the ashes across the floor.</p>

            <section class="character-profile" id="lowell-coogan">
                <h2>Lowell & Coogan (The Cheater and The Suicide)</h2>
                <p>This pair represents the dark, destructive side of the gold fever. Lowell was a "cunning and ruthless" claim manager. He was the man who cheated Harry Darby out of his fortune (leading to Darby's suicide) and was also the man Jack believed helped Peter Ide steal his 400 kilos of gold.</p>
                <p>Coogan was a lawyer whom Darby had hired, and who was also cheated by Lowell. Driven to despair, Coogan "committed suicide by tying a heavy stone to one leg" and drowning himself in a water-filled prospecting hole. Jack found his note left on a crossbeam: "HOUSE OF DEATH. CURSED BE ALL PEOPLE WHO ENTER HERE".</p>
