                <h2>The Book</h2>
                <p><em>Kapten Jack; 22 år på Nya Guinea</em> ("Captain Jack: 22 Years in New Guinea") was a Swedish memoir published in 1951. It was written as an "as-told-to" narrative, based on the first-person accounts of the real "Captain Jack" after he returned to Sweden.</p>
                <p>This website is based on a full English translation of that text.</p>
                <p>The memoir is a vital historical document. It provides a rare, eyewitness account of events (like the murder of Helmuth Baum) and key figures (like "Sharkeye" Bill Park and the "Big Six") that are often only footnotes in other, more formal histories of the Morobe gold rush.</p>

                <h2>The Narrator</h2>
                <p>"Captain Jack" was a Swedish national who came to the Mandated Territory of New Guinea in the 1920s. He was a professional recruiter, schooner captain, and cargo master for large firms like Burns, Philp & Company before the "gold-fever" led him to become a prospector.</p>
                <p>His identity is defined by his tools—an accordion to "civilize" and entertain the natives, and a small cannon packed with rags to intimidate them with a "loud bang". His memoir provides a raw, unfiltered look into the colonial mindset of the 1920s pioneer.</p>

                <h2>A Historical Note</h2>
                <p>This website presents the stories as told by Captain Jack. While the people and events are historically verified, the narrative is filtered through his personal biases.</p>
                <p>The descriptions of the native "Kanak" population are prejudiced and reflect the colonial attitudes of the era. He refers to them as "unreliable and dangerous children". We present this history uncensored, as a vital (though difficult) part of understanding the period.</p>
