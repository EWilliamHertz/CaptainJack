                <h1>True Stories of Life and Death in New Guinea</h1>
                <p>The goldfields produced more than just gold; they produced incredible legends. The memoir captures the most famous (and infamous) stories of the era, which were told in the bars of Rabaul and Wau.</p>

                <h2>Story 1: The Angel of Bulolo</h2>
                <p>Doris Booth's story was legendary. A qualified Australian nurse, she was determined to join the rush but was blocked by regulations that barred white women from the "uncontrolled" territory. Undeterred, she "smuggled herself to Salamoa" on a schooner.</p>
                <p>She then "at gunpoint" led her own carrier line for weeks through the jungle, arriving in the Bulolo valley to the astonishment of the miners. She established her home, "Cliffside," and planted a garden that provided fresh vegetables, saving many men from the ravages of beriberi.</p>
                <p>Her title, the **"Angel of Bulolo,"** was earned during a deadly dysentery epidemic. With the coast cut off, she "had her boys build a primitive hospital" and heroically nursed the miners, saving "many lives".</p>

                    <h3>Historical Context: From Nurse to Legislator</h3>
                    <p>Doris Booth's legend is one of the most well-documented of the era. She was, as the memoir states, an Australian nurse (Doris Regina Booth, 1895-1970). For her heroic work in the dysentery epidemic, she was awarded the **O.B.E. (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 1928**.</p>
                    <p>She published her own memoir of these events, *Mountain Gold and Cannibals*, in 1928. After her career as a successful goldminer and company director, she was appointed as the **first female member of the Legislative Council of Papua and New Guinea** (1951-1957).</p>

                <h2>Story 2: The Eldorado Outhouse</h2>
                <p>Harry Darby's path to fortune was one of the most "comical"—and true—stories of the gold rush. In Rabaul, he was an "impossible" government clerk, a notorious prankster who once cussed out the governor on the phone (thinking it was a friend) and later locked the governor's secretary in the native prison overnight by accident.</p>
                <p>After being fired, he made his way to Edie Creek (Kiendi). He arrived late and all the best land was claimed. Needing to set up camp, he "ordered his boys to build an outhouse... measured out a two-meter square" and pointed to a random spot. A few feet down, their shovels struck one of the richest, most concentrated pockets of gold in the entire valley.</p>
                <p>The "Eldorado Outhouse" claim made him a millionaire, but his story ended tragically. He was later cheated out of his fortune and "committed suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills" in Bombay.</p>

                <h2>Story 3: The King of Vitu</h2>
                <p>Peter Hansen was a pioneer whose legend was told in Rabaul's bars. Known as the "King of Vitu," he was the first white man on the island and built a "high palisade" fort to trade for copra. He famously "fished for copra" by using booms to hoist coconuts in and lower trade goods out, never making direct contact.</p>
                <p>His fort was eventually attacked by the natives, who coveted his steamship. For five desperate days, Hansen and his Buka boys held the fort in a brutal siege. Out of water, they fought their way to the beach and escaped in a "rickety canoe," only to be rescued at sea by a passing schooner "moments before" the Vitu war canoes caught them.</p>

                <h2>Story 4: The Bitten Ear and the Urn</h2>
                <p>This "macabre" story from the "wild west" town of Wau perfectly captures the frontier atmosphere. The central character was "Tiger Lil" Andreason, a "tall and elegant blonde" notorious for her beauty and her "effective left hook".</p>
                <p>One night in the Wau hotel bar, a brawl erupted between two of her suitors, Sam and Charley. The fight turned savage when Sam bit off half of Charley's ear. "Tiger Lil," in a drunken, "sentimental" rage, decided to end the fight. She grabbed the heavy urn containing her dead husband's ashes and "threw the urn at Charley's head," shattering it and scattering the ashes across the barroom floor.</p>
